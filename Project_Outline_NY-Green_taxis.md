# NYC Taxi Data Analysis

## Project Title:
NYC Taxi Data Analysis

## Project Due Date:
July 17, 2024

## Team Members:
- Meagan O’Connor
- Aysenyr Teyfur
- Jorge Reyes
- Valdeir Faria F.

## Project Description:
This project aims to analyze the NYC Taxi Dataset to understand traffic and congestion patterns, fare and revenue dynamics, and geospatial trends within New York City. By leveraging this data, we will uncover insights that can inform urban transportation planning, economic policies, and improve the efficiency and sustainability of taxi services.

## Project Outline:
### Data Collection and Preparation:
1. Access and download the NYC Taxi Dataset from [Azure Open Datasets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/open-datasets/dataset-taxi-yellow?tabs=azureml-opendatasets).
2. Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the basic characteristics of the dataset.

### Traffic and Congestion Analysis:
1. Analyze temporal patterns to identify peak hours and days for taxi usage.
2. Calculate ride durations and analyze their variation across different times and locations.
3. Map traffic intensity across different areas of the city using heatmaps.

### Fare and Revenue Analysis:
1. Compute average fares and analyze fare distribution for various trip lengths.
2. Investigate tipping patterns and their variation across different times and areas.
3. Identify key factors influencing fare prices through regression analysis or machine learning models.

### Geospatial Analysis:
1. Identify and visualize major pickup and drop-off hotspots using geospatial mapping techniques.
2. Analyze ride patterns across different boroughs and neighborhoods to identify trends and anomalies.
3. Use clustering algorithms to detect underserved areas with low taxi availability and high demand.

### Results Interpretation and Reporting:
1. Summarize key findings from each analysis section.
2. Visualize results using graphs, charts, and maps to provide clear insights.
3. Discuss the implications of findings for urban transportation planning, policy-making, and taxi service optimization.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:
1. Provide a comprehensive summary of insights gained from the analysis.
2. Offer recommendations for improving taxi services and addressing identified issues.
3. Suggest potential areas for further research or data collection to enhance the understanding of urban transportation dynamics.

## Research Questions to Answer:
### Traffic and Congestion Analysis:
- What are the peak hours for taxi rides in NYC?
- How do ride durations vary by time of day and day of the week?
- Which areas of the city experience the highest levels of taxi traffic?

### Fare and Revenue Analysis:
- What are the average fares for different types of trips (e.g., short vs. long distances)?
- How do tipping patterns vary across different times and locations?
- What factors most significantly affect fare prices (e.g., distance, time of day, weather conditions)?

### Geospatial Analysis:
- What are the hotspots for taxi pickups and drop-offs?
- How do ride patterns change across different boroughs or neighborhoods?
- Can we identify underserved areas with low taxi availability?

## Datasets to Be Used:
